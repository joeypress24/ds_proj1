Project 1 for Data Structures
https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/crabbe/IC312/current/project/01/project.html

Goal of the project: implement stack and queue interfaces using linked lists and arrays to generate and solve mazes
Must do so without using java.util library

NOTE: attended EI with Dr. Crabbe for this project on 21SEP21.

1. I completed every step of the project.
2. I probably spent around 2-3 hours on this project overall, but that included EI
with prof. Crabbe.
